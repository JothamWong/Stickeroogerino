This is a simple python3 script that uses the replicate API to create a sticker pack (webp format) for telegram stickers. You will need to supply a replicate API token and download the python3 dependencies.

It will not automatically generate a telegram sticker pack (I thought about doing so, but think the effort required is still too high regardless), you will need to manually do it yourself if you are pleased with the sticker quality ig. Tbh, the stickers generated are pretty lit.

I added a batch of pepe stickers (that are kinda a weird pepe fusion) which still look pretty neat. Idk what the replicate api limit is but I was able to generate about 50 stickers for free so far.
